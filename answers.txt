Tasks:
1.	Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device in mobile cloud. Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
Yes, but it is better to use driver.close() in tear down because a device isn't reloaded in this case.
2.	Change settings to run native test on a certain/random Android device in mobile cloud.
Add support of appPackage and appActivity parameters for Android devices (reading from a .properties file and then setting in the DesiredCapabilities). Locally installed Appium DT has no need in these parameters, but for Appium server of EPAM mobile cloud itï¿½s mandatory.
3.	 Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
No, it started to pass only after installing the app on the device.
4.	Try to use autoLaunch capability with app as before instead of appPackage and appActivity. Does this approach work?
No, because we don't have the possibility to install app via this way. We need to use the Install App function on Mobile Farm.
5.	What's wrong with our code? How to fix/improve it? Implement your suggestions.
I think it is better to have different projects for iOS web tests and Andriod native. These web tests aren't connected with the native android test.
 We don't test app and it's web version here. So that's why they should be different projects.
